# Murafik – Smart Healthcare & Seizure Monitoring System

## Overview

Murafik is an intelligent healthcare companion system designed to improve the patient journey through real-time health monitoring, wearable sensor integration, and seamless communication between patients, doctors, supervisors, and healthcare organizations.

The system combines a Flutter mobile application, backend APIs, biomedical wearable sensors, and a hospital management dashboard into one integrated healthcare ecosystem.

Murafik focuses on:

* Real-time patient monitoring
* Seizure and abnormal activity detection
* Healthcare workflow management
* Remote medical supervision
* Smart patient engagement
